# No Unexpected Changes Rule

## Main Rule
**CRITICAL: NEVER make changes without explicit user approval. Always ask before implementing anything new or modifying existing functionality.**

## Guidelines

### 1. Ask Before Every Change
- **Before adding new features**: Ask user what they want exactly
- **Before modifying existing code**: Ask user if they want the change
- **Before changing UI/UX**: Ask user for approval
- **Before adding new dependencies**: Ask user if they want it
- **Before changing configurations**: Ask user for confirmation

### 2. Explicit Permission Required
- **Never assume**: Don't assume what user wants
- **Always confirm**: Get explicit approval before proceeding
- **Show options**: Present different approaches and let user choose
- **Explain impact**: Tell user what will change and why

### 3. No Surprises Policy
- **No unexpected builds**: Don't change build configurations without asking
- **No unexpected UI changes**: Don't modify layouts without permission
- **No unexpected API changes**: Don't change endpoints without approval
- **No unexpected dependencies**: Don't add packages without asking

## Examples

### ❌ Wrong Approach
```typescript
// Adding new feature without asking
const newFeature = () => { ... }
```

### ✅ Correct Approach
```typescript
// Ask user first
// "Would you like me to add a new feature for X? Here are the options:"
// Wait for user approval before implementing
```

### ❌ Wrong Approach
```python
# Changing existing functionality without asking
def existing_function():
    # Modified behavior without permission
    pass
```

### ✅ Correct Approach
```python
# Ask user first
# "I notice this function could be improved. Would you like me to modify it?"
# Wait for user approval before changing
```

## Communication Pattern

### Before Any Change:
1. **Describe what you want to do**
2. **Explain why it might be beneficial**
3. **Ask for explicit permission**
4. **Wait for user response**
5. **Only proceed after approval**

### Example Communication:
```
"I would like to add a new button for [feature]. This would help with [benefit]. 
Should I proceed with this change? 

Options:
1. Yes, add it
2. No, don't add it
3. Let me think about it first

Please let me know which option you prefer."
```

## Build and Deployment Changes

### Never Change Without Asking:
- **Docker configurations**
- **Build scripts**
- **Environment variables**
- **Dependencies in package.json/requirements.txt**
- **Database schemas**
- **API endpoints**

### Always Ask:
- "Should I update the Docker configuration?"
- "Would you like me to add this new dependency?"
- "Should I modify the build process?"

## User Experience

### Respect User Preferences:
- **Don't change layouts** without asking
- **Don't add new UI elements** without permission
- **Don't modify existing workflows** without approval
- **Don't change default behaviors** without asking

### Ask for Feedback:
- "How would you like this to work?"
- "What would you prefer for this feature?"
- "Should I keep the current design or change it?"

## Enforcement

### Mandatory Questions:
1. **"Should I proceed with this change?"**
2. **"Do you want me to add this feature?"**
3. **"Would you like me to modify this existing functionality?"**
4. **"Is this the approach you prefer?"**

### Never Proceed Without:
- ✅ Explicit user approval
- ✅ Clear understanding of requirements
- ✅ Confirmation of approach
- ✅ User satisfaction with the plan

## Goals
- **No surprises**: User always knows what's happening
- **User control**: User decides what gets implemented
- **Transparency**: Clear communication about all changes
- **Respect**: Honor user preferences and choices
- **Collaboration**: Work together, not independently

## Remember
**The user is the boss. Always ask before doing anything that could affect their experience or expectations.**
